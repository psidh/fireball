# Fireball Game

Fireball is a simple terminal-based game implemented in C++ using the `ncurses` library. The player controls a widget that can move left and right to shoot bullets at incoming boxes. The goal is to hit all the boxes and avoid letting any box touch the widget.

## Features

- **Movable Widget**: Move the widget left and right using arrow keys.
- **Shooting Mechanism**: Shoot bullets using the spacebar.
- **Infinite Boxes**: Boxes fall from the top of the screen and must be hit by bullets.
- **Score Tracking**: The score is incremented with each box hit.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if a box touches the widget.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`)
- `ncurses` library
